Dear friends, 
AI and Machine Learning are transforming multiple industries, and I want to help you become great at it. I have been writing a book, Machine Learning Yearning, to teach you strategies for structuring Machine Learning projects. If you would like to receive free draft chapters as they are released, please sign up at:

The ML MOOC and deeplearning.ai¡¯s Deep Learning Specialization teach a lot of technical algorithms, but the best AI technologists also need to know how to structure an ML project.
This book is focused not on teaching you ML algorithms, but on how to use ML algorithms. If you aspire to be a technical leader in AI and want to learn how to set direction for your team's work, this book will help.
Most of this content is not taught in typical ¡°academic¡± ML courses. It is drawn from my experience building and shipping many deep learning products. After reading this book, you will be able to: 
?	Prioritize the most promising directions for an AI project
?	Diagnose errors in a machine learning system
?	Build ML in complex settings, such as mismatched training/test sets
?	Set up an ML project to compare to and/or surpass human-level performance
?	Know when and how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning
I've seen teams waste months or years because they don¡¯t understand the principles taught in this book. I hope it will save you months of time.
I had started working on this book over a year ago, but I got distracted building the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. Now that the specialization is complete, I¡¯m returning to this and hope you will benefit from it!
